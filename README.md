### Project Name
**Naive Bayes Classifier for Machine Learning**

### Project Details
This project implements a Naive Bayes classifier using MATLAB, aimed at classifying data based on the Bayes theorem. The classification process involves preprocessing data, computing prior probabilities, and utilizing likelihoods for prediction.

#### Contents:
1. **Introduction**
   - Overview of the Naive Bayes classifier.
   - Explanation of Bayes Theorem and its application to classify instances based on predictor values.

2. **Description**
   - The project includes several MATLAB scripts and a dataset (`data.txt`).
   - Key functions include:
     - `NavieBayesClassifier.m`: Main script that orchestrates data loading, preprocessing, model training, and testing.
     - `createset.m`: Function to split the dataset into training and test sets.
     - `probability.m`: Function to compute prior probabilities and likelihoods.
     - `ClassifyTestSet.m`: Function to classify the test set using Bayes theorem.
     - `probabilityLaplace.m`: An improved version of the probability function using Laplace smoothing.

3. **Results**
   - The model was evaluated with a 1000-run simulation, providing average error rates for classification with and without smoothing.

### Technical Implementation

#### 1. Data Preprocessing
- The dataset is loaded from `data.txt`, which contains instances with multiple predictors and class labels.
- The data is randomly divided into a training set (10 instances) and a test set (remaining instances) using `createset.m`.

#### 2. Building the Naive Bayes Classifier
- The classifier computes prior probabilities \( P(c) \) and likelihoods \( P(x|c) \) for each feature.
- The likelihood is calculated using the frequency of each feature level given a class.

#### 3. Classification Process
- The classification of test instances is done using `ClassifyTestSet.m`, which applies the Bayes theorem to compute posterior probabilities.
- The predicted class is determined by selecting the class with the highest posterior probability.

#### 4. Laplace Smoothing
- To improve classification accuracy, Laplace smoothing is applied in `probabilityLaplace.m`, which modifies likelihood calculations to handle unseen feature values.

### Evaluation
- The average error rates were observed:
  - **Without Smoothing:** 0.35
  - **With Smoothing:** 0.40
- The results highlight the challenges of the dataset size and the impact of Laplace smoothing on model performance.
